Welcome to Let's CV! This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application. By using Let's CV, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy.

## 1.0 Information We Collect

### 1.1 Types of Data Collected
We collect only user activity information, including:
- Screens opened within the app.
- Count of profiles created and content interactions.

Additionally, Let's CV uses Google AdMob to show ads. While we do not know the exact data Google collects, please refer to Google’s privacy policy for details.

### 1.2 How Data Is Collected
- **Firebase Analytics:** We use Firebase Analytics to automatically gather user activity data such as screen views and usage patterns. This data collection helps improve app functionality and user experience.

## 2.0 What Personal Information we collect about you and how we collect it
Let's CV does not require registration or login, and thus does not collect identifiable personal information directly from you. Data collection is limited to:
- User activity and interaction within the app as described above.

Data is stored on your device using SQLite without encryption.

## 3.0 Why We Collect Data
The primary purpose of collecting this data is to improve app usage and functionality based on user interactions. We analyze this data to:
1. Enhance user experience.
2. Optimize app performance.
3. Understand user preferences and usage patterns.

## 4.0 Data Usage and Sharing
Let's CV operates fully offline regarding the sharing of user data. We do not share your data with any third parties, except:
- Data collected by Firebase Analytics or Google through AdMob may be processed by those services. 
- We have no direct control over what data these third-party services collect or share.

## 5.0 User Rights and Controls
Since Let's CV does not require registration or store personally identifiable information beyond user activity:
- Users have full control over how they use the app.
- Users can delete their locally stored CV profiles and personal information at any time.
- There are no mechanisms within the app for registration, login, or profile management tied to personal identification.

## 6.0 Data Security Measures
We store your data locally on your device using SQLite. While we do not apply additional encryption within the app, we recommend using device-level security measures (such as encryption or PIN locks) to protect your personal data.

## 7.0 Data Retention
Your data, such as CV profiles and personal information, remains stored on your device until you choose to delete it. We do not automatically remove or anonymize this data without your consent.
